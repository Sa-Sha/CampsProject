# Camps v1:
## Part 1: 3 initial routes
package: ejs express
npm install --save ejs express

/  : home routes
/camps: list all the camps we have
/camps/new : ths is for creating new camps

skeleton for our project:
public:
   css:
    js:
 views:
      landing.ejs
      new.ejs
      camps.ejs
      partials

data and want to display on the camps page:


for /camps/newï¼š
form with:
          name
          image
          button
once user clicked the button/submit the form, it will go to the /camps page and display all the camps along with the newly created one

note: difference between GET and POST
GET: to get info from server
POST: to add info into the server

in order for POST to work, we need another package:
body-parser
npm install --save body-parser
var bodyParser= require("body-parser");
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended: true}));

#part 2: layout and basic styling
1: create header.ejs and footer.ejs in the partials folder
2: get bootstrap CDN and put it in the header.ejs
